- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamiejanesky
- 👀 I’m interested in unpaid internships to gain real world data science experience. I am a full time 2nd grade teacher, so my internship will need to be flexible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science. It's my second master's degree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can be of assistance on.
- 📫 How to reach me jamie.janesky@eastern.edu
